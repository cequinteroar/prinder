# Prinder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.
This project represents a tinder way to show products and like them or dislike them.
The project was totally done with Angular, sass, javascript and observables.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Coding style

The coding style I used is modular, where the tinder card of the product can be portable.
All the needed functionalities related to fetching data were separated into services.
All the interfaces for the products, attributes, etc are located inside the folder models, trying to preserve the MVC pattern.

## What was considered?

For the development was done research about dating apps, taking as reference tinder and bumble. The card presentation was taken from the way those apps show a person.
The colours were chosen in order to be simplistic, where blue, white and black were the main colours and red and green were indicator colours for actions (e.g. like and dislike).
All the icons were taken from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/
